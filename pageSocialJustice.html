									<h3>Why did I choose the topic of Climate Change?</h3>
									<p>I chose this topic because I had taken various Environmental Science classes in the past. To ensure that I did not completely forget the information I had learned, I decided to implement it into a project. Basically, I took the easy route and did a topic I was very familiar with. This doesn't necessarily mean I remembered everything; I had to relearn a few things through my research, and also to research additional information that I most likely didn't learn yet in those classes.</p>
									<h3>What did I want to express through the editorial montages?</h3>
									<p>I made at most 4. I wanted to express the effects through the photo montage of a factory polluting the atmosphere and the water being filled with trash (On page 4), and how the effects of climate change were felt through the maps (On page 6). I chose to mostly cover the US and Canada, as both countries have different legislation regulating greenhouse gas pollution and deforestation, and the data really shows that for Greenhouse gases, as only 2 provinces (Alberta and Saskatchewan) release a significant amount of pollutants into the atmosphere, the other 8 provinces and 3 territories do emit greenhouse gases, but not a significant amount to warrant an inclusion in the data. This contrasts with 48/50 (Excluding Maine and Vermont as they don't emit that many greenhouse gases) states in the US emitting a significant amount of pollutants into the atmosphere. I felt like I did a good job on choosing these two nations. I could have included another country like Mexico, but this data already satisfied me.</p>
									<h3>What were the challenges of visualizing data?</h3>
									<p>As previously established, the other 8 provinces and 3 territories of Canada emit so few greenhouse gases that I wasn't sure if I wanted to include them at all. In the end, I decided not to include them, even if I did include data for those provinces and territories of Canada, it would still show the contrast in Greenhouse Gas regulation between the US and Canada.</p>
									<h3>What were the challenge(s) of working in three programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign)?</h3>
									<p>My main challenge was importing the design files from Illustrator. When I tried to do this, a lot of the vectors would distort weirdly, and I tried to adjust the import settings, I tried exporting the Illustrator files as a .svg which gave similar results, but I gave up and ended up redoing the vectors (Seen on Pages 2 and 3) directly into the InDesign project, which is most likely bad practice, but at least this way I wouldn't have any problems as it's done in the .indd file itself.</p>
									<h3>Did your ideas about the topic change while doing the project?</h3>
									<p>Since I mostly used information I learned in the Environmental Science classes in the past, and I used reliable sources to search up other information, such as Green technologies, this just reinforced my opinions on Climate Change, that it's bad and we need to act now to minimize the effects of it.</p>
